# Loan Conflict Detector using Inverted Index

Introduction
This project aims to find conflicts between loans listed in multiple files by utilizing the inverted index algorithm. The inverted index is a data structure that stores a mapping from words or terms to their corresponding documents or locations, which makes it an efficient tool for searching and analyzing large datasets.

In this project, we will create an inverted index of all the loan files and use it to identify any conflicts that exist between them. A conflict occurs when there are two or more loans with the same borrower's name, loan amount, and date of disbursement.
